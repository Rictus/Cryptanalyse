<h2>The Console</h2>
<p>This is the primary window where all your work will be handled. The console window allows for single-line inputs (commonly known as <em>one-liners</em>), which means you won't be able to type new-lines. A good example is maybe when you want to declare a <strong>function</strong>. You won't be able to write this:</p>
<pre><code>function hello() {
    return &quot;hello world&quot;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, you'll write the above like this:</p>
<p><code>function hello() {
    return &quot;hello world&quot;
}</code></p>
<p>This is probably why many developers and experts love using consoles or <strong>REPL</strong>s (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) as they let you write seemingly huge pieces of code in just one statement without involving new-lines anywhere.</p>
<p>The <code>ENTER</code> or <code>Return</code> key will now act as your execution key. As an addition, the <code>F5</code> key, which is used by many as the <em>Debugging</em> or <em>Compile</em> key in most IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) is also implemented for execution. The inputs you type are also referred to as a <em>commands</em> or in this case <em>JavaScript commands</em>.</p>
<p>Once your execution happens, it's added to your <em>commands-history list</em>. In the <em>options</em> menu, you can choose to let this list be remembered even after closing the application letting you be able to browse through your previous (and current) list of commands even on restarting the application.</p>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>To navigate or browse through your previous list of commands, just use the Up (<code>↑</code>) Arrow key. Once you reach to the top of your previous commands list while navigating, the cursor will be positioned at the very first character (the left-most part) of the current command in the console's editor to give you an immediate feedback that it's through with navigating the list. When navigating down your list of former commands (using the Down (<code>↓</code>) Arrow key), the cursor will always be positioned at the last character of those commands.</p>
<p>Though for many consoles, once you type something then leave without executing it and begin navigating back to some previous command, the command is not saved, with DeskJS, this is possible. You are able to type anything without executing it, then as you start navigating up your history list, the command typed will by default be added as a temporary command in your history list. This will let you scroll back to it once you're done checking on some previous command. Also, whenever you've enabled your previous commands to be saved, the very last command you typed will be set back again once you launch the application. This will allow for more productivity and convenience as you use the console. You can also view your commands-history list by clicking on the <em>previous console commands</em> icon at the very bottom-right corner of the console's window.</p>
<h3>The Results panel</h3>
<p>All your results will be viewed in the results panel, which is displayed just above the console's editor. This is where you will be given feedback on all your executed JavaScript commands by their outputs. The results panel is able to let you understand the currently <em>(or lastly)</em> executed command by distinguishing its result from others previously executed. You will notice that the lastly outputted result is in <strong>bold</strong> text and is much larger than other results thereby allowing you to distinguish it from the others. This <em>visual formatting</em> style will let you understand the result that was lastly output on execution in a much easier and simpler fashion. As an addition, <em>double-clicking</em> on any result will copy it to the clipboard. Clicking once on any result will let you manually select and/or modify it.</p>
<h3>The Completions list</h3>
<p>The completions list allows you to view a list of all <em>keywords</em> and <em>objects</em> in JavaScript. You can be able to access the list by pressing on <code>CTRL + TAB</code>. Also, you can start by typing a few letters of any particular keyword, then press on <code>CTRL + TAB</code> to quickly complete it. For example, typing <code>fun</code> then pressing on <code>CTRL + TAB</code> will complete for you the keyword <code>function</code> with a space included allowing you to type the function name you wish to declare. Another nice addition is that you can also view the list of functions within a JavaScript Object such as the <strong>Math</strong> Object by typing the keyword followed by a <em>dot</em>, then pressing on the same key combination <code>CTRL + TAB</code>. A list of all the functions implemented in the Object will be displayed for you to select. You therefore won't actually need to do some referencing for the internal methods from the Internet to remind yourself. It's always a really handy tool to remember.</p>
<h3>Special commands</h3>
<p>Special commands let you perform some actions in the console which are usually graphically-driven. A good example is if you wish to clear your output results. You can easily do so by typing <code>cls</code> in the console then pressing on <code>ENTER</code>. This gives you a more convenient way of doing some quick automations just by typing and executing a few keywords right from the console.</p>
<p>You can view the list of special commands usable in DeskJS simply by typing <code>help</code> and executing it in the console. All the special commands such as <code>about</code> and <code>restart</code> are well stated there.</p>
