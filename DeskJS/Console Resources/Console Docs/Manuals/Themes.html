<h2>Themes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>What are themes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Themes are small files that are able to define how DeskJS will look like based on their settings which are mostly <em>color</em> settings.</p>
<p>Themes are defined in <strong>JSON</strong> (JavaScript Object Notation) format, which is a very simplified file format as compared to the previously stated format known as XML. Theme files consists of different settings (for example: <code>console_color</code>) and their values (for example: <code>&quot;Blue&quot;</code>) set besides them. Each setting uses this kind of format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>setting</code> : <code>&quot;value&quot;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This allows for a much simplified file definition based on how you want DeskJS to look like. A theme can also be put inside a folder together with its <em>Icon package</em> which will be discussed later in this guide. For beginners, well don't be afraid of this because even you can create your own theme(s) just by reading through this guide. Now lets go through the complete theme-file format with one of the default themes developed with DeskJS, which is the <em>Light</em> theme:</p>
<pre><code>{

     &quot;author&quot; : &quot;Willy Kimura&quot;,

     &quot;icon_package&quot; : &quot;Default Icon Packages/Dark&quot;,

     &quot;console_color&quot; : &quot;White&quot;,

     &quot;outline_color&quot; : &quot;DarkGray&quot;,

     &quot;app_title_color&quot; : &quot;Black&quot;,

     &quot;title_labels_color&quot; : &quot;Black&quot;,

     &quot;subtitle_labels_color&quot; : &quot;Black&quot;,

     &quot;textbox_color&quot; : &quot;White&quot;,

     &quot;textbox_fore_color&quot; : &quot;Black&quot;,

     &quot;buttons_color&quot; : &quot;DarkGray&quot;,

     &quot;buttons_fore_color&quot; : &quot;White&quot;,

     &quot;editor_fore_color&quot; : &quot;Black&quot;,

     &quot;editor_pointer_color&quot; : &quot;DimGray&quot;,

     &quot;syntax_errors_color&quot; : &quot;Tomato&quot;,

     &quot;runtime_errors_color&quot; : &quot;Green&quot;,

     &quot;list_selection_color&quot; : &quot;DodgerBlue&quot;,

     &quot;list_items_color&quot; : &quot;Black&quot;,

     &quot;list_subitems_color&quot; : &quot;DimGray&quot;,

     &quot;list_selected_items_color&quot; : &quot;White&quot;,

     &quot;list_selected_subitems_color&quot; : &quot;White&quot;

}
</code></pre>

<p>All themes should be saved with a <strong>.console-theme</strong> extension for them to be recognized in the <em>Console Themes</em> folder. The <em>Console Themes</em> folder is found within the <em>Console Resources</em> folder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the experienced JavaScript programmers, you may not even need to go through the whole <em>Explanation</em> section if you clearly understand what's going on and how the JSON file format works. The <code>icon_package</code> setting is however different from other theme settings as it defines the Icon package that will be applied based on your theme. You can read about it. Also to state, you can define colors based on their names, for example <code>&quot;Green&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;LightSkyblue&quot;</code> or you may even use <strong>Hexadecimal</strong> or Hex color definitions such as <code>&quot;#00ff00&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;#994b00&quot;</code>. The <strong>RGB</strong> color format is however not supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>We'll now go through the full list of settings as described above.</p>
<p>To begin with, if you wish to add some explanations for each or some of your settings, you can use <strong>comments</strong> which usually begin with <em>double forward-slashes</em> <code>//</code> just like in JavaScript. Also, notice that all the settings described above have a <em>comma</em> at the end <strong>except</strong> for the very last setting. This means that the last setting should not have a <em>comma</em> as it's to mean that that marks the end of all the settings in your theme file. Plus, you don't need to follow any order when defining your theme's settings as shown above. You may mix them together, but don't forget to include any setting when mixing them.</p>
<p>Let's begin:</p>
<h4>Author</h4>
<p><code>&quot;author&quot; : &quot;Willy Kimura&quot;</code>,</p>
<p>As stated before, this file format defines everything in it based on a <code>setting</code> : <code>value</code> style allowing each property to have its own name and value <em>(also commonly know as <code>name</code> : <code>value</code> pairs)</em>. So for the above setting, you are allowed to set your name as the author of the theme. Notice that for Strings or statements, you will need to write them with <em>double-quotes</em> like: <code>author</code> : <code>&quot;James&quot;</code>. This will apply for all the settings in all the themes you'll create.</p>
<h4>Icon package</h4>
<p>This is the setting that specifies the <em>icon package</em> you want to be used whenever a user applies your theme. By default, there are two icon packages that come pre-packaged with DeskJS, that is, the <em>Dark</em> and <em>Light</em> icon packages. The <em>Dark</em> icon package consists of dark (or black) icons that can be used with bright backgrounds while the <em>Light</em> icon package consists of light (or white) icons that can be used with dark backgrounds. You can find them in the <em>Default Icon Packages</em> folder stored within the <em>Console Themes</em> folder. If you just want to use any of the default icon packages created instead of creating your own icon package, you can specify by typing either of the below:</p>
<p><code>&quot;icon_package&quot; : &quot;Default Icon Packages/Dark&quot;,</code>
<code>&quot;icon_package&quot; : &quot;Default Icon Packages/Light&quot;,</code></p>
<p>The <em>forward slash</em> indicates that you're accessing a certain folder in the <code>Default Icon Packages</code> folder. This is to mean that you can even nest other icon packages within the same folder.</p>
<p>Icon packages are simply <strong>folders</strong> which can consist of images of <strong>.png</strong> (Portable Network Graphics) or <strong>.ico</strong> (Icon) extension types. You can also mix different images of the mentioned extensions in one icon package. Your icon package will need to have all the relevant images as contained in either the <strong>Light</strong> or <strong>Dark</strong> icon packages. You can view the list of images there. Also, you will notice that there's a folder known as <em>Dialogs</em> in both the <em>Dark</em> and <em>Light</em> icon packages. This folder contains icons that the users can specify by default when using the <code>alert</code>, <code>prompt</code>, and <code>confirm</code> dialogs as we shall see later on in another guide. You may also wonder why other icons exist in that folder that are not quite that relevant to JavaScript's popup dialogs. Don't worry, they'll be of use in future... be assured of that!</p>
<p>If you want to package your theme in a folder together with your own icon package, make sure to reference your icon package inside your theme in this format:</p>
<p><code>&quot;icon_package&quot; : &quot;Folder Name/Icon package&quot;,</code></p>
<p>For example, say you've created a theme named <em>Hello.console-theme</em> and inserted it into a folder you've called <strong>Hello Theme</strong>. Then, inside the folder, you've added the theme's icon package called <strong>MyIcons</strong>, you can specify this in your theme file's icon package setting as:</p>
<p><code>&quot;icon_package&quot; : &quot;Hello Theme/MyIcons&quot;,</code></p>
<p>The <code>/</code> character specifies that you want to access a certain folder within the parent theme folder which in our example is <strong>Hello Theme</strong>. As an addition, you can also add a number of themes in your theme folder together with a number of icon packages since this model favours mixing different themes all in one theme folder.</p>
<p>Such an example can be put like this <em>(based on our example)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Hello Themes/
            /MyDark icons
            /MyLight icons
            Hello Light.console-theme
            Hello Dark.console-theme
</code></pre>

</blockquote>
<p>The above details the folder and file structure for including multiple theme-files and icon packages all in one folder. At this point, the <strong>Hello Themes</strong> folder can be referred to as a <strong>Theme package</strong> rather than a normal theme file.</p>
<h4>Console Color</h4>
<p>This basically specifies the <em>background color</em> of the console. The format is as below:</p>
<p><code>&quot;console_color&quot; : &quot;White&quot;</code>,</p>
<p>You can either use natural color-names such as <code>White</code> or <code>Blue</code>, or use Hex-color-names which are much more broad and specific such as <code>#00ff00</code> which stands for color Green. To get started with learning how they work, just head over to <a href="www.w3schools.com">w3schools Color Picker</a> where you'll be able to mix different colors and see their results shown in this color format. You won't even need to learn them since all the heavy-lifting of knowing such colors will be done for you.</p>
<h4>Outline color</h4>
<p>This specifies the <em>outline</em> or <em>border color</em> of the console together will all the other windows in DeskJS. Below is the format:</p>
<p><code>&quot;outline_color&quot; : &quot;DarkGray&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>Application title color</h4>
<p>This specifies the title color of DeskJS which is found in the Homescreen.</p>
<p><code>&quot;app_title_color&quot; : &quot;Black&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>Title labels color</h4>
<p>This specifies the color of all the title labels in the application. A good example is the <em>Tooltip</em> which consists of a <em>Title</em> and a <em>Description</em>.</p>
<p><code>&quot;title_labels_color&quot; : &quot;Black&quot;,</code></p>
<h4>Subtitle labels color</h4>
<p>This specifies the color of all the subtitle labels in the application. The same example of the <em>Tooltip</em> still applies here, letting you style the color of its subtitle.</p>
<p><code>&quot;subtitle_labels_color&quot; : &quot;Black&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>Textbox color</h4>
<p>This specifies the <em>background color</em> of all the text-boxes <em>(or input-boxes)</em> in DeskJS.</p>
<p><code>&quot;textbox_color&quot; : &quot;White&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>Textbox fore color</h4>
<p>This specifies the <em>text color</em> of all the text-boxes in DeskJS. This, in-short is to mean the color of the text you will type inside any textbox in the application.</p>
<p><code>&quot;textbox_fore_color&quot; : &quot;Black&quot;,</code></p>
<h4>Buttons color</h4>
<p>This specifies the <em>background color</em> of all the buttons in DeskJS; from the <code>alert</code> popup-box to even the <code>confirm</code> popup-box.</p>
<p><code>&quot;buttons_color&quot; : &quot;DarkGray&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>Buttons fore color</h4>
<p>This, just like the textbox, specifies the text found within the different buttons in the application. It sets the <em>text color</em> of all the buttons in DeskJS.</p>
<p><code>&quot;buttons_fore_color&quot; : &quot;White&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>Editor fore color</h4>
<p>The <em>editor</em> refers to the place where you'll be writing your JavaScript code in the console. It's also referred to a the <em>Console's editor</em>. This setting specifies the color of the code you will type in the console's editor. Make sure that it's visible enough based on the <strong>background color</strong> you set for the Console. </p>
<p><code>&quot;editor_fore_color&quot; : &quot;Black&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>Editor pointer color</h4>
<p>The <em>editor pointer</em> or <em>console pointer character</em> refers to the default two arrow-characters (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>) that point to the console's editor. You can change their color too by using the below setting with a color of your choice: </p>
<p><code>&quot;editor_pointer_color&quot; : &quot;DimGray&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>Syntax errors color</h4>
<p>Syntax errors in JavaScript are those errors that result from not following the language or grammar rules correctly and as expected. A good example is, if you try to write an <strong>if</strong> conditional statement and you miss a closing curly brace <code>}</code> at the end, this will result to a syntax error since you haven't yet stated the end of the <em>if</em> statement. Below is its setting and a default value:</p>
<p><code>&quot;syntax_errors_color&quot; : &quot;Tomato&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>Runtime errors color</h4>
<p>These errors are of different types or classes in JavaScript. However, they are different from <em>Syntax Errors</em> as they result from your code not having a meaningful fact (or logical/semantic rules) even though they follow the correct JavaScript grammar. A good example is when you are trying to call a <em>function</em> that does not exist or hasn't been created yet. This will result into a runtime error.</p>
<p><code>&quot;runtime_errors_color&quot; : &quot;Green&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>List selection color</h4>
<p>This setting allows you to set the <em>selection color</em> that will appear on any item selected in a list. A good example of a list is the <strong>Results</strong> list. For the <em>Light</em> theme, once you start hovering over the results, you will notice a <em>bluish</em> color appearing. This is it's <strong>selection color</strong> which is set to <em>DodgerBlue</em>. Other types of lists are the <em>themes</em> and <em>completions</em> list.</p>
<p><code>&quot;list_selection_color&quot; : &quot;DodgerBlue&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>List items color</h4>
<p>This will set the default color of the list items in any list. By default, the <em>Light</em> theme sets all list items with a <strong>Black</strong> color since the <em>background color</em> is <strong>White</strong> to make them easily visible.</p>
<p><code>&quot;list_items_color&quot; : &quot;Black&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>List subitems color</h4>
<p>Though the <strong>Results</strong> list does not have sub-items, other lists such as the <em>themes</em> and the <em>snippets</em> list do have them. This setting will allow you to set any default color for their sub-items. By default, the <em>Light</em> theme comes with a less black color known as <em>DimGray</em>.</p>
<p><code>&quot;list_subitems_color&quot; : &quot;DimGray&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>List selected items color</h4>
<p>As goes by its name, this setting allows you to set the color of any selected item in a list. If you set the <em>selection color</em> to be of a dark type (such as <em>Black</em>), then make sure the selected items color is of a rather light type (for example <em>White</em>).</p>
<p><code>&quot;list_selected_items_color&quot; : &quot;White&quot;</code>,</p>
<h4>List selected subitems color</h4>
<p>Likewise, for sub-items, ensure that the color follows the same rule as that of the items, though still you may play around with other colors to see how well they may turn-out to be. It's just a matter of mixing different colors and seeing their results in your theme.</p>
<p><code>&quot;list_selected_subitems_color&quot; : &quot;White&quot;</code></p>
<h3>Previewing your themes</h3>
<p>To be able to easily preview <em>(or debug)</em> your themes after you've ensured that your theme file has all the available settings in place, you can apply the theme from the <em>themes list</em> by pressing on <code>Ctrl + L</code>. Thereafter, to refresh your theme once you've made any changes to the color settings, just press on <code>F6</code>  from the console's editor which will quickly refresh your currently applied theme.</p>
